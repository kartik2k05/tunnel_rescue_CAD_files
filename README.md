This 3D cutaway view of a railway tunnel equipped with a specially designed I-beam-based rescue system for a permanent solution for rescue operation in tunnel . The setup is carefully engineered to fit within the tunnel’s operational clearance as defined by Indian Railways' Schedule of Dimensions (SOD), ensuring it doesn't interfere with regular train movement or the overhead electrification system (OHE).

At the heart of the system is the central red I-beam, mounted approximately 4700–4800 mm above the rail level. This beam serves as the track for rescue trolleys that carry suspended stretchers, allowing victims to be safely transported during emergencies. Along the tunnel walls, two blue I-beams act as side supports. These are placed beyond the maximum moving dimension (MMD), ensuring there's no obstruction to passing trains.

The support structure relies on robust steel brackets, spaced every 2 meters, and anchored into the tunnel lining using M16 chemical bolts. Each bracket is reinforced with diagonal braces to ensure the system remains stable, even under load or during vibrations caused by train movement.

In the image, you can see the trolley-pulley mechanism in action—stretchers are securely attached using hooks and guided smoothly along the beam. The entire system is aligned to a tolerance of ±5 mm, ensuring precision and ease of operation.

This rescue solution not only meets the structural safety criteria laid out in IS 800 and IS 456 but also allows for thermal expansion with specially planned joints every few meters. Designed to handle both straight and curved tunnel profiles, this system is modular, easy to maintain, and ready for rapid deployment, making it a reliable choice for future-ready tunnel rescue operations in India’s rail network.
